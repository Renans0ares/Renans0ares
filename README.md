# Hi there! I'm Renan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **full-stack developer** passionate about technology, functional interfaces, and creative solutions that truly make an impact. My journey began in 2019 when I started studying and working with computer maintenance, and since then, I've been fully immersed in the world of software development.

In 2021, I started my career as a back-end developer and, after a year, was promoted to Development Analyst. I've been constantly learning and evolving, working on both front-end and back-end projects. I'm also a volunteer in my local church and strive to maintain a balanced routine between faith, learning, and technology.
